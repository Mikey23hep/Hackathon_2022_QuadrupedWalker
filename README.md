Hackathon_2022_QuadrupedWalker
This is the code for a basic Quadruped Walker. It has manual control via a python GUI as well as autopilot mode via arduino. 
Version 1.0.0

Description----------------------------------
This was made for hackathon 2022 at Kansas State University. https://devpost.com/software/autonomous-quadruped-walker. We won 1st place for best hardware hack at the event.
This device was not the final product that we had in mind. We had hoped to have several other features on the device and this is more of a working prototype.

Fututre Plans--------------------------------
Version 2.0.0 is in the works which will include:
  a. New 3D printed structures
  b. Algorithm Refinements
  c. New movements
  d. More options for user control and settings
  e. Distance mapping and plotting.
  f. Machine Learning
  g. More advanced AI system.
